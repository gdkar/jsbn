# JavaScript BigNum library

Modern, modular, linted package of Tom Wu's JavaScript implementation of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic.

Advantages over Tom Wu's [original implementation](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) and Jason Davies' [fork](https://github.com/jasondavies/jsbn) are:

* A top-level module to prevent polluting the global scope
* Unit tests
* JSLint compliance
* A distributable, minified and production-ready library
